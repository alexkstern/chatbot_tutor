Sliding Mechanism of Actin and Myosin ATP binds to the myosin head, breaking the cross-bridge between actin and myosin ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to change position and swivel, moving them towards the next actin binding site The myosin heads bind to the new actin sites and return to their original conformation This reorientation drags the actin along the myosin in a sliding mechanism The myosin heads move the actin filaments in a similar fashion to the way in which an oar propels a row boat  Sliding Filaments Mechanism  4.  Sarcomere Shortening The repeated reorientation of the myosin heads drags the actin filaments along the length of the myosin As actin filaments are anchored to Z lines, the dragging of actin pulls the Z lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere As the individual sarcomeres become shorter in length, the muscle fibres as a whole contracts  Diagrams of Sarcomere Shortening  Summary of Muscle Contractions Action potential in a motor neuron triggers the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium ions bind to troponin (on actin) and cause tropomyosin to move, exposing binding sites for the myosin heads The actin filaments and myosin heads form a cross-bridge that is broken by ATP ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to swivel and change orientation Swiveled myosin heads bind to the actin filament before returning to their original conformation (releasing ADP + Pi) The repositioning of the myosin heads move the actin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere The sliding of actin along myosin therefore shortens the sarcomere, causing muscle contraction  Muscle Contraction Summary Please Note: In this animation the myosin head is attached to actin when ATP hydrolysis causes it to swivelIn reality, the myosin head swivels when unattached and then returns to its original conformation following actin binding\",\n          \"GMOs (genetically

Sliding Mechanism of Actin and Myosin ATP binds to the myosin head, breaking the cross-bridge between actin and myosin ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to change position and swivel, moving them towards the next actin binding site The myosin heads bind to the new actin sites and return to their original conformation This reorientation drags the actin along the myosin in a sliding mechanism The myosin heads move the actin filaments in a similar fashion to the way in which an oar propels a row boat  Sliding Filaments Mechanism  4.  Sarcomere Shortening The repeated reorientation of the myosin heads drags the actin filaments along the length of the myosin As actin filaments are anchored to Z lines, the dragging of actin pulls the Z lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere As the individual sarcomeres become shorter in length, the muscle fibres as a whole contracts  Diagrams of Sarcomere Shortening  Summary of Muscle Contractions Action potential in a motor neuron triggers the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium ions bind to troponin (on actin) and cause tropomyosin to move, exposing binding sites for the myosin heads The actin filaments and myosin heads form a cross-bridge that is broken by ATP ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to swivel and change orientation Swiveled myosin heads bind to the actin filament before returning to their original conformation (releasing ADP + Pi) The repositioning of the myosin heads move the actin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere The sliding of actin along myosin therefore shortens the sarcomere, causing muscle contraction  Muscle Contraction Summary Please Note: In this animation the myosin head is attached to actin when ATP hydrolysis causes it to swivelIn reality, the myosin head swivels when unattached and then returns to its original conformation following actin binding\",\n          \"GMOs (genetically modified organisms) have been artificially manipulated through genetic engineering to express new traits There are a number of possible applications for the genetic modification of organisms: Agricultural crops are commonly modified to improve yield, growth rates and nutritional value Genetically modified animals may be used to grow human transplant tissues and organs (xenotransplantation) A number of microorganisms are being considered as future clean fuel producers and\\u00a0biodegraders Pharmaceutical companies are exploring the possibilities of introducing vaccines, antibodies and medicines into foods  Current Applications of GMOs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['Completion'][9]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"id":"LgjvjPxpYNfg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709386754801,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":60,"user":{"displayName":"Alexander Stern","userId":"00538493364231383129"}},"outputId":"ffc8a378-c089-4833-c43c-d0d86c520702"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'The capacity of stem cells to divide and differentiate along different pathways is necessary in embryonicdevelopment and also makes stem cells suitable for therapeutic uses  When a cell differentiates and becomes specialised, it loses its capacity to form alternative cell types Stem cells are unspecialised cells that have two key qualities: 1.

Potency – They have the capacity to differentiate into specialised cell types Types of Stem Cells There are four main types of stem cells present at various stages of human development: Totipotent – Can form any cell type, as well as extra-embryonic (placental) tissue (e.g. zygote) Pluripotent – Can form any cell type (e.g. embryonic stem cells) Multipotent – Can differentiate into a number of closely related cell types (e.g.\\xa0haematopoeitic adult stem cells) Unipotent – Can not differentiate, but are capable of self renewal (e.g. progenitor cells, muscle stem cells)   Uses of Stem Cells Stem cells are necessary for embryonic development as they are an undifferentiated cell source from which all other cell types may be derived Cell types that are not capable of self-renewal (e.g. amitotic nerve tissues) are considered to be non-stem cells As these tissues cannot be regenerated or replaced, stem cells have become a viable therapeutic option when these tissues become

Sliding Mechanism of Actin and Myosin ATP binds to the myosin head, breaking the cross-bridge between actin and myosin ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to change position and swivel, moving them towards the next actin binding site The myosin heads bind to the new actin sites and return to their original conformation This reorientation drags the actin along the myosin in a sliding mechanism The myosin heads move the actin filaments in a similar fashion to the way in which an oar propels a row boat  Sliding Filaments Mechanism  4.  Sarcomere Shortening The repeated reorientation of the myosin heads drags the actin filaments along the length of the myosin As actin filaments are anchored to Z lines, the dragging of actin pulls the Z lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere As the individual sarcomeres become shorter in length, the muscle fibres as a whole contracts  Diagrams of Sarcomere Shortening  Summary of Muscle Contractions Action potential in a motor neuron triggers the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium ions bind to troponin (on actin) and cause tropomyosin to move, exposing binding sites for the myosin heads The actin filaments and myosin heads form a cross-bridge that is broken by ATP ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to swivel and change orientation Swiveled myosin heads bind to the actin filament before returning to their original conformation (releasing ADP + Pi) The repositioning of the myosin heads move the actin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere The sliding of actin along myosin therefore shortens the sarcomere, causing muscle contraction  Muscle Contraction Summary Please Note: In this animation the myosin head is attached to actin when ATP hydrolysis causes it to swivelIn reality, the myosin head swivels when unattached and then returns to its original conformation following actin binding\",\n          \"GMOs (genetically

Sliding Mechanism of Actin and Myosin ATP binds to the myosin head, breaking the cross-bridge between actin and myosin ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to change position and swivel, moving them towards the next actin binding site The myosin heads bind to the new actin sites and return to their original conformation This reorientation drags the actin along the myosin in a sliding mechanism The myosin heads move the actin filaments in a similar fashion to the way in which an oar propels a row boat  Sliding Filaments Mechanism  4.  Sarcomere Shortening The repeated reorientation of the myosin heads drags the actin filaments along the length of the myosin As actin filaments are anchored to Z lines, the dragging of actin pulls the Z lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere As the individual sarcomeres become shorter in length, the muscle fibres as a whole contracts  Diagrams of Sarcomere Shortening  Summary of Muscle Contractions Action potential in a motor neuron triggers the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium ions bind to troponin (on actin) and cause tropomyosin to move, exposing binding sites for the myosin heads The actin filaments and myosin heads form a cross-bridge that is broken by ATP ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to swivel and change orientation Swiveled myosin heads bind to the actin filament before returning to their original conformation (releasing ADP + Pi) The repositioning of the myosin heads move the actin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere The sliding of actin along myosin therefore shortens the sarcomere, causing muscle contraction  Muscle Contraction Summary Please Note: In this animation the myosin head is attached to actin when ATP hydrolysis causes it to swivelIn reality, the myosin head swivels when unattached and then returns to its original conformation following actin binding\",\n          \"GMOs (genetically

a separate circulation for the lungs\\nThere is a separate circulation for the lungs The human heart is a chambered organ, consisting of two atria and two ventricles The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles) The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at high pressure via arteries The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because there are two distinct locations for blood transport The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart) The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further  Overview of Pulmonary and Systemic Circulation'\",\n          \"11.3

Water levels within an organism are constantly changing as a result of metabolic activity Water is produced via condensation reactions (anabolism) and is consumed during hydrolysis reactions (catabolism) The concentration of water within cells (osmolarity) will impact tissue viability (i.e. governs osmotic pressure within cells) Animals may be either osmoconformers or\\u00a0osmoregulators according to how they manage their internal osmotic conditions: Osmoconformers maintain internal conditions that are equal to the osmolarity of their environment Osmoregulators keep their body\\u2019s osmolarity constant, regardless of environmental conditions By matching internal osmotic conditions to the environment, osmoconformers minimise water movement in and out of cells Less energy is used to maintain internal osmotic conditions within an osmoconformer While osmoregulation is a more energy-intensive process, it ensures internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled Osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions whereas osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions  Osmoconformers versus\\u00a0Osmoregulators'\",\n          \"3.5 Genetic Modification and Biotechnology\\nVector delivery:\\nIn molecular biology, a vector is a vehicle that is used to deliver genetic material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer There are several methods for transferring genetic material, but all mechanisms can be classed as either viral or non-viral Non-Viral Delivery A commonly used vector is a plasmid \\u2013 a circular DNA molecule capable of self-replication and autonomous protein expression Electroporation \\u2013 An electric current is applied to make temporary holes in the cell membrane Heat shocking \\u2013 Thermal energy is used to briefly destabilise the cell membrane to allow for vector entry Particle bombardment \\u2013 DNA-coated particles are shot into the cells by a gene gun Microinjection \\u2013 A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector directly into the cell Lipofection \\u2013 The vector is transferred within a liposome (a vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)  Viral Delivery The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be driven by endogenous expression patterns A disadvantage of this practice is that there is

Sliding Mechanism of Actin and Myosin ATP binds to the myosin head, breaking the cross-bridge between actin and myosin ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to change position and swivel, moving them towards the next actin binding site The myosin heads bind to the new actin sites and return to their original conformation This reorientation drags the actin along the myosin in a sliding mechanism The myosin heads move the actin filaments in a similar fashion to the way in which an oar propels a row boat  Sliding Filaments Mechanism  4.  Sarcomere Shortening The repeated reorientation of the myosin heads drags the actin filaments along the length of the myosin As actin filaments are anchored to Z lines, the dragging of actin pulls the Z lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere As the individual sarcomeres become shorter in length, the muscle fibres as a whole contracts  Diagrams of Sarcomere Shortening  Summary of Muscle Contractions Action potential in a motor neuron triggers the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum Calcium ions bind to troponin (on actin) and cause tropomyosin to move, exposing binding sites for the myosin heads The actin filaments and myosin heads form a cross-bridge that is broken by ATP ATP hydrolysis causes the myosin heads to swivel and change orientation Swiveled myosin heads bind to the actin filament before returning to their original conformation (releasing ADP + Pi) The repositioning of the myosin heads move the actin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere The sliding of actin along myosin therefore shortens the sarcomere, causing muscle contraction  Muscle Contraction Summary Please Note: In this animation the myosin head is attached to actin when ATP hydrolysis causes it to swivelIn reality, the myosin head swivels when unattached and then returns to its original conformation following actin binding\",\n          \"GMOs (genetically

a separate circulation for the lungs\\nThere is a separate circulation for the lungs The human heart is a chambered organ, consisting of two atria and two ventricles The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles) The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at high pressure via arteries The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because there are two distinct locations for blood transport The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart) The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further  Overview of Pulmonary and Systemic Circulation'\",\n          \"11.3

osmolarity constant, regardless of environmental conditions By matching internal osmotic conditions to the environment, osmoconformers minimise water movement in and out of cells Less energy is used to maintain internal osmotic conditions within an osmoconformer While osmoregulation is a more energy-intensive process, it ensures internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled

Modification and Biotechnology\\nVector delivery:\\nIn molecular biology, a vector is a vehicle that is used to deliver genetic material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer There are several methods for transferring genetic material, but all mechanisms can be classed as either viral or non-viral Non-Viral Delivery A commonly used vector is a plasmid \\u2013 a circular DNA molecule capable of self-replication and autonomous protein expression Electroporation \\u2013 An electric current is applied to make temporary holes in the cell membrane Heat shocking \\u2013 Thermal energy is used to briefly destabilise the cell membrane to allow for vector entry Particle bombardment \\u2013 DNA-coated particles are shot into the cells by a gene gun Microinjection \\u2013 A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector directly into the cell Lipofection \\u2013 The vector is transferred within a liposome (a vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)  Viral Delivery The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be driven by endogenous expression patterns A disadvantage of this practice is that there is a risk the random insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes Viruses can have either a DNA genome (adenovirus) or an RNA genome (retrovirus) Retroviruses use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert the RNA sequence into a DNA copy prior to integration  Overview of Viral Delivery (Adenovirus)'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

System\\nCirculation:\\nUnderstanding:\\u2022 \\u00a0There is a separate circulation for the lungs\\nThere is a separate circulation for the lungs The human heart is a chambered organ, consisting of two atria and two ventricles The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles) The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at high pressure via arteries The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because there are two distinct locations for blood transport The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart) The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further

osmoconformers\\nAll animals are either osmoregulators or osmoconformers Water levels within an organism are constantly changing as a result of metabolic activity Water is produced via condensation reactions (anabolism) and is consumed during hydrolysis reactions (catabolism) The concentration of water within cells (osmolarity) will impact tissue viability (i.e. governs osmotic pressure within cells) Animals may be either osmoconformers or\\u00a0osmoregulators according to how they manage their internal osmotic conditions: Osmoconformers maintain internal conditions that are equal to the osmolarity of their environment Osmoregulators keep their body\\u2019s osmolarity constant, regardless of environmental conditions By matching internal osmotic conditions to the environment, osmoconformers minimise water movement in and out of cells Less energy is used to maintain internal osmotic conditions within an osmoconformer While osmoregulation is a more energy-intensive process, it ensures internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled Osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions whereas osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions

material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer There are several methods for transferring genetic material, but all mechanisms can be classed as either viral or non-viral Non-Viral Delivery A commonly used vector is a plasmid \\u2013 a circular DNA molecule capable of self-replication and autonomous protein expression Electroporation \\u2013 An electric current is applied to make temporary holes in the cell membrane Heat shocking \\u2013 Thermal energy is used to briefly destabilise the cell membrane to allow for vector entry Particle bombardment \\u2013 DNA-coated particles are shot into the cells by a gene gun Microinjection \\u2013 A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector directly into the cell Lipofection \\u2013 The vector is transferred within a liposome (a vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)  Viral Delivery The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be driven by endogenous expression patterns A disadvantage of this practice is that there is a risk the random insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes Viruses can have either a DNA genome (adenovirus) or an RNA genome (retrovirus) Retroviruses use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert the RNA sequence into a DNA copy prior to integration  Overview of Viral Delivery

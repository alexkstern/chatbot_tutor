[2 marks]\\nMarkscheme:\\n- light/photon absorbed by pigment molecules (in photosystem II)/chlorophyll; energy/electrons passed to chlorophyll molecule at the reaction centre; causes electron to be raised to higher energy level / electron is excited; this electron passed along chain of carrier molecules in photosystem II;\\n###\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"df_p2"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-eb2fabe5-00c1-42d1-9cb5-daa5e95b321e\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>p2 question and answers</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Question: Outline the various stages of the ce...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Question: Describe the characteristics of stem...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Question: Explain how minerals move into plant...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Question: Draw a labelled diagram to show the ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Question: Draw a labelled diagram of the ultra...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>322</th>\n","      <td>Question: Label the structures indicated on th...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>323</th>\n","      <td>Question: State when PAN was injected into the...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>324</th>\n","      <td>Question: Describe the origin of eukaryotic ce...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>325</th>\n","      <td>Question: Deduce whether the excretion of ammo...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>326</th>\n","      <td>Question: Outline the process of in vitro fert...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>327 rows × 1 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-eb2fabe5-00c1-42d1-9cb5-daa5e95b321e')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-eb2fabe5-00c1-42d1-9cb5-daa5e95b321e button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

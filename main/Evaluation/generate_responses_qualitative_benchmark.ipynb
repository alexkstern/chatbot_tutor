Self-Renewal: Stem cells can continuously divide and replicate themselves for long periods. This means they can produce a consistent and renewable source of cells that can replace damaged or diseased cells in the human body.\n","\n","2.

Personalized Medicine: Stem cells can be harvested from the patient’s body, reducing the risk of rejection and eliminating the need for anti-rejection drugs. \n","\n","5. Disease Modeling: Stem cells can be used to create models of diseases in a lab. This can help researchers understand disease progression and develop new treatments.\n","\n","6.

These cells secrete the hormone insulin in response to elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin helps to lower blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells for energy production, storage of glucose in the liver and muscles, and inhibition of glucose production by the liver. This feedback mechanism helps to maintain blood glucose levels within a narrow range, ensuring that cells receive the necessary energy while preventing excessive levels of glucose in the blood.\",\n          \"Certainly! \\n\\nUnique sequences in nuclear DNA refer to segments of DNA that are found only once or a few times within the genome. These sequences typically code for specific proteins or have regulatory functions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, highly repetitive sequences in nuclear DNA are short segments of DNA that are repeated many thousands to millions of times throughout the genome. These sequences do not code for proteins and their exact functions are not fully understood, but they are thought to play a role in chromosome structure and stability.\\n\\nIn a human cell, unique sequences make up the majority of the nuclear DNA, as they are responsible for encoding the vast array of proteins needed for various cellular functions. Highly repetitive sequences, while abundant in number, make up a smaller proportion of the overall nuclear DNA content.\",\n          \"Of course! The heart is a muscular organ that acts as a pump to circulate blood throughout the body. It has four chambers: two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles.\\n\\nHere's how the heart pumps blood:\\n1. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cava.\\n2. The right atrium contracts, forcing the blood into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.\\n3. The right ventricle contracts, pumping the deoxygenated blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery.\\n4. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.\\n5. Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.\\n6. The left atrium contracts, pushing the oxygenated blood into the left ventricle through the mitral valve.\\n7. The left ventricle contracts, pumping the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta.\\n8.

Glucagon, on the other hand, increases blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of glucose from liver cells.\",\n          \"\\nThe difference between unique and highly repetitive sequences in nuclear DNA can be explained by considering the fact that most of a human cell's DNA is contained in the nucleus. Unique sequences refer to those parts of the genome that are present only once in each individual, while highly repetitive sequences are found multiple times throughout the genome. The presence of these different types of sequences allows for genetic variation among individuals as well as specific functions within cells. For example, unique sequences may contain genes responsible for coding proteins or regulating gene expression, whereas highly repetitive sequences may serve structural purposes such as forming chromosomes or insulating regions from damage due to environmental factors like radiation exposure. Additionally, some highly repetitive sequences have been linked with certain diseases when they become unstable over time due to mutations occurring at their locations on chromosomes. Understanding this distinction helps us better understand how our genomes work together to create healthy functioning organisms!\",\n          \"The heart is a muscle that pumps blood through the body.

Then it returns to the left side of the heart where it enters the left atrium before going into the left ventricle.

cells have several unique properties that make them valuable for medical applications. Firstly, they can self-renew, meaning they can divide and produce more stem cells like themselves. This allows for an unlimited supply of these cells, ensuring that there is always enough available for therapeutic purposes. Secondly, stem cells have the ability to differentiate into various cell types, such as neurons, muscle cells, or blood cells. This means that they can be used to replace damaged or diseased tissues in the body, potentially treating conditions like Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, or heart failure. Additionally, stem cells possess immunomodulatory properties, which means they can regulate the immune system and reduce inflammation. This makes them useful in treating autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory diseases. Finally, stem cells have the potential to regenerate tissue, helping to repair damage caused by injury or disease. Overall, the versatility, self-renewal, differentiation, immunomodulation, and regenerative capabilities of stem cells make them promising candidates for future medical treatments.\",\n"," 341,\n"," 234,\n"," 34.12]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":58}],"source":["answer_ft_mistral(df_questions['Qualitative benchmark question'][0],500)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tqdm import tqdm\n","list_answers= [answer_ft_mistral(question,500) for question in tqdm(df_questions['Qualitative benchmark question'])]\n","list_just_answers=[answer[0] for answer in list_answers]\n","df_questions['Fine Tuned Mistral Answer']=list_just_answers\n","list_tokens_in=[answer[1] for answer in list_answers]\n","df_questions['Fine Tuned Mistral input tokens']=list_tokens_in\n","list_tokens_out=[answer[2] for answer in list_answers]\n","df_questions['Fine Tuned Mistral output tokens']=list_tokens_out\n","list_time_taken=[answer[3] for answer in list_answers]\n","df_questions['Fine Tuned Mistral time taken']=list_time_taken\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"a1033917-d3e0-4ff3-f46f-c426e1f5b05e","id":"Suy-FMLbJoqS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713578900342,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":984693,"user":{"displayName":"Alexander Stern","userId":"00538493364231383129"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 35/35 [16:24<00:00, 28.12s/it]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_questions"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"wfrvISnfJoqT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713578900343,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":215,"user":{"displayName":"Alexander Stern","userId":"00538493364231383129"}},"outputId":"3a229bf5-8064-464d-e5c5-43690cbf76d0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                       Qualitative benchmark question  \\\n","0   What are the characteristics of stem cells tha...   \n","1   Can you explain a technique of gene transfer t...   \n","2   Can you explain the structure of the plasma me...   \n","3   What are two factors that influence the rate o...   \n","4       Can you explain the structure of a sarcomere?

When blood glucose levels rise after a meal, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin acts as a signal for cells throughout the body to take up glucose from the blood, lowering blood glucose levels. Conversely, when blood glucose levels drop, alpha cells in the pancreas secrete glucagon, which signals the liver to break down glycogen stores and release glucose back into the bloodstream, raising blood glucose levels. This intricate balance between insulin and glucagon ensures that blood glucose levels remain within normal ranges, allowing our bodies to function optimally.\",\n          \"Sure! In general, there are two types of DNA sequences found in the nucleus of a human cell: unique and highly repetitive. Unique sequences refer to those that are present only once or a few times in the genome, while highly repetitive sequences are repeated many times throughout the genome.\\n\\nUnique sequences play crucial roles in various biological functions such as gene expression, regulation, and protein synthesis. They contain genes that encode proteins essential for life, including enzymes, hormones, and structural components like collagen. These genes are typically located in specific regions called \\\"gene clusters\\\" within the chromosomes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, highly repetitive sequences are often involved in noncoding RNA production, which has regulatory functions in gene expression. These sequences can also contribute to chromatin organization, influencing how tightly or loosely DNA is packed inside the nucleus. Additionally, they may have a role in genetic recombination during meiosis (sexual reproduction).\\n\\nIt's important to note that not all repetitive sequences are considered highly repetitive. Some repetitive elements, such as transposable elements, are present in multiple copies but do not necessarily repeat across the entire genome. Instead, they tend to insert themselves into specific locations within the genome, resulting in a mosaic pattern of repeats.\\n\\nIn summary, unique sequences are responsible for encoding proteins and regulating gene expression, while highly repetitive sequences contribute to noncoding RNA production, chromatin organization, and genetic recombination. Both types of sequences play vital roles in the functioning of a human cell.\",\n          \"The heart is a muscular organ responsible for circulating blood throughout the body. It consists of four chambers - two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). Blood enters the right atrium through the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava, then flows into the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, moves into the left ventricle, and is finally pushed out through the aorta to supply the rest of the body with freshly oxygenated blood. This process is known as the cardiac cycle or cardiac rhythm.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Fine Tuned

Self-Renewal: Stem cells have the ability to divide and replicate themselves for long periods. This ability is crucial in therapeutic applications where a large number of cells may be needed for treatment.\n","\n","2. Potency: Stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types. This potential allows them to develop into virtually any cell in the body, including heart muscle cells, blood cells, nerve cells, etc. Hence, they can be used to replace or repair damaged tissues in a variety of medical conditions.\n","\n","For instance, in the treatment of Stargardt's disease, stem cells can be used to replace degenerated retinal photoreceptor cells. Similarly, in Parkinson's disease, stem cells can replace dead nerve cells with living, dopamine-producing ones.\n","\n","Moreover, the availability of different types of stem cells, such as totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, and unipotent, allows for a range of therapeutic applications.

Unique sequences refer to regions of DNA that are present only once in the genome, while highly repetitive sequences refer to regions of DNA that are repeated multiple times throughout the genome. Most of a human cell's DNA is contained in the nucleus, which includes both unique and highly repetitive sequences. The unique sequences are important for encoding genetic information, while the highly repetitive sequences play various roles such as gene regulation, chromosomal stability, and genomic imprinting.\",\n          \"The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest, and it has four chambers - two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. Blood flows from the body into the right atrium through veins, then passes into the right ventricle, which pumps it out of the heart and into the lungs via arteries. In the lungs, oxygen is picked up by red blood cells while carbon dioxide is released. Then, blood returns to the left atrium through veins, moves into the left ventricle, and gets pumped back out into the body via arteries. This cycle repeats itself continuously to supply oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs and tissues.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

Insulin stimulates adipocytes to absorb glucose and convert it into fatty acids. This process is called lipogenesis. When blood glucose levels are low, pancreatic cells secrete glucagon, which causes liver cells to release stored glycogen into the bloodstream as glucose. This process is called glycogenolysis. The net effect is that pancreatic cells regulate blood glucose levels by controlling the amount of glucose available for absorption by tissues.\",\n          \"Yes, I can explain the difference between unique and highly repetitive sequences in nuclear DNA. Most of a human cell's DNA is contained within the nucleus, which means it is non-coding and does not encode for proteins. This non-coding DNA includes both unique and highly repetitive sequences. Unique sequences are specific to each individual and are used for identification purposes (e.g., fingerprinting). Highly repetitive sequences, on the other hand, are repeated multiple times throughout the genome and are often involved in gene regulation. They may also serve as telomeres or centromeres.\",\n          \"The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest cavity. It has four chambers - two atria (top) and two ventricles (bottom). Blood flows into the right atrium via the vena cava and exits the left atrium via the pulmonary artery. Deoxygenated blood returns to the right side of the heart through the inferior and superior vena cava, while oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart via the pulmonary vein. The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery, while the left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood throughout the body via the aorta. The heart contracts and relaxes in a rhythmic fashion called a cardiac cycle. During each cardiac cycle, the atria contract before the ventricles do. This allows for the ventricles to fill with blood before they push it forward. When the ventricles contract, pressure within the aorta increases until the aortic valve opens. Once the ventricles have pushed all the blood out, the atria contract again, pushing any remaining blood back into the ventricles. This process repeats itself over several cycles, allowing the heart to continuously pump blood throughout the body.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

System\\nCirculation:\\nUnderstanding:\\u2022 \\u00a0There is a separate circulation for the lungs\\nThere is a separate circulation for the lungs The human heart is a chambered organ, consisting of two atria and two ventricles The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles) The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at high pressure via arteries The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because there are two distinct locations for blood transport The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart) The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further

osmoconformers\\nAll animals are either osmoregulators or osmoconformers Water levels within an organism are constantly changing as a result of metabolic activity Water is produced via condensation reactions (anabolism) and is consumed during hydrolysis reactions (catabolism) The concentration of water within cells (osmolarity) will impact tissue viability (i.e. governs osmotic pressure within cells) Animals may be either osmoconformers or\\u00a0osmoregulators according to how they manage their internal osmotic conditions: Osmoconformers maintain internal conditions that are equal to the osmolarity of their environment Osmoregulators keep their body\\u2019s osmolarity constant, regardless of environmental conditions By matching internal osmotic conditions to the environment, osmoconformers minimise water movement in and out of cells Less energy is used to maintain internal osmotic conditions within an osmoconformer While osmoregulation is a more energy-intensive process, it ensures internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled Osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions whereas osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions

material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer There are several methods for transferring genetic material, but all mechanisms can be classed as either viral or non-viral Non-Viral Delivery A commonly used vector is a plasmid \\u2013 a circular DNA molecule capable of self-replication and autonomous protein expression Electroporation \\u2013 An electric current is applied to make temporary holes in the cell membrane Heat shocking \\u2013 Thermal energy is used to briefly destabilise the cell membrane to allow for vector entry Particle bombardment \\u2013 DNA-coated particles are shot into the cells by a gene gun Microinjection \\u2013 A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector directly into the cell Lipofection \\u2013 The vector is transferred within a liposome (a vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)  Viral Delivery The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be driven by endogenous expression patterns A disadvantage of this practice is that there is a risk the random insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes Viruses can have either a DNA genome (adenovirus) or an RNA genome (retrovirus) Retroviruses use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert the RNA sequence into a DNA copy prior to integration  Overview of Viral Delivery

The drying of clay particles could have precipitated catalysing reactions needed for the formation of organic molecules. As for extraterrestrial origins, the necessary conditions required for the formation of life may have initially been derived on other planets like Mars.

two atria and two ventricles The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles) The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at high pressure via arteries The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because there are two distinct locations for blood transport The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart) The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further

material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer There are several methods for transferring genetic material, but all mechanisms can be classed as either viral or non-viral Non-Viral Delivery A commonly used vector is a plasmid \\u2013 a circular DNA molecule capable of self-replication and autonomous protein expression Electroporation \\u2013 An electric current is applied to make temporary holes in the cell membrane Heat shocking \\u2013 Thermal energy is used to briefly destabilise the cell membrane to allow for vector entry Particle bombardment \\u2013 DNA-coated particles are shot into the cells by a gene gun Microinjection \\u2013 A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector directly into the cell Lipofection \\u2013 The vector is transferred within a liposome (a vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)  Viral Delivery The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be driven by endogenous expression patterns A disadvantage of this practice is that there is a risk the random insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes Viruses can have either a DNA genome

is collected via veins and passed on to the ventricles. \\n###\\nQ: Why does the heart have two sets of atria and ventricles?\\nA: The heart has two sets of atria and ventricles because there are two distinct locations for blood transport. The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) and the right side pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation).\\n###\\nQ: What is the difference between the left and right side of the heart in terms of circulation?\\nA: The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) and the right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation).

This minimizes water movement in and out of cells, using less energy to maintain internal osmotic conditions.\\n\\n###\\n\\nQ: How do osmoregulators manage their internal osmotic conditions and what is the implication of this process?\\nA: Osmoregulators manage their internal osmotic conditions by keeping their body's osmolarity constant, regardless of environmental conditions. This is a more energy-intensive process, but it ensures that internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled.\\n\\n###\\n\\nQ: What is the difference between osmoconformers and osmoregulators in terms of their response to environmental conditions?\\nA: The difference between osmoconformers and osmoregulators in terms of their response to environmental conditions is that osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions irrespective of the environment, while osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions.\",\n          \"Q: What is a vector in the context of molecular biology?\\nA: A vector is a vehicle that is used to deliver genetic material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer.\\n\\n###\\nQ: What are the two main classes of vector delivery mechanisms in genetic modification?\\nA: The two main classes of vector delivery mechanisms are viral and non-viral.\\n\\n###\\nQ: What are some examples of non-viral delivery methods for genetic material?\\nA: Examples of non-viral delivery methods include the use of a plasmid, electroporation, heat shocking, particle bombardment, microinjection, and lipofection.\\n\\n###\\nQ: How does viral delivery work and what are some of its advantages and disadvantages?\\nA: Viral delivery works by inserting a viral vector into a cell, a process called transduction, and utilises the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell.

circulation for the lungs\\nThere is a separate circulation for the lungs The human heart is a chambered organ, consisting of two atria and two ventricles The atria act as reserviors, by which blood returning to the heart is collected via veins (and passed on to ventricles) The ventricles act as pumps, expelling the blood from the heart at high pressure via arteries The reason why there are two sets of atria and ventricles is because there are two distinct locations for blood transport The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart) The left side of the heart will have a much thicker muscular wall (myocardium) as it must pump blood much further  Overview of Pulmonary and Systemic Circulation'\",\n          \"11.3 The Kidney and Osmoregulation\\nExcretory systems:\\nUnderstanding:\\u2022 \\u00a0All animals are either osmoregulators or osmoconformers\\nAll animals are either osmoregulators or osmoconformers Water levels within an organism are constantly changing as a result of metabolic activity Water is produced via condensation reactions (anabolism) and is consumed during hydrolysis reactions (catabolism) The concentration of water within cells (osmolarity) will impact tissue viability (i.e. governs osmotic pressure within cells) Animals may be either osmoconformers or\\u00a0osmoregulators according to how they manage their internal osmotic conditions: Osmoconformers maintain internal conditions that are equal to the osmolarity of their environment Osmoregulators keep their body\\u2019s osmolarity constant, regardless of environmental conditions By matching internal osmotic conditions to the environment, osmoconformers minimise water movement in and out of cells Less energy is used to maintain internal osmotic conditions within an osmoconformer While osmoregulation is a more energy-intensive process, it ensures internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled Osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions whereas osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions  Osmoconformers versus\\u00a0Osmoregulators'\",\n          \"3.5 Genetic Modification and

briefly destabilise the cell membrane to allow for vector entry Particle bombardment \\u2013 DNA-coated particles are shot into the cells by a gene gun Microinjection \\u2013 A glass micropipette is used to inject the vector directly into the cell Lipofection \\u2013 The vector is transferred within a liposome (a vesicle capable of fusion with the cell membrane)  Viral Delivery The insertion of a viral vector into a cell is called transduction and utilise the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell Viruses integrate their DNA directly into the host genome, which can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences The advantage of this practice is that protein synthesis will be driven by endogenous expression patterns A disadvantage of this practice is that there is a risk the random insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes Viruses can have either a DNA genome (adenovirus) or an RNA genome (retrovirus) Retroviruses use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert the RNA sequence into a DNA copy prior to integration  Overview of Viral Delivery (Adenovirus)'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

of the atria in the human heart?\\nA: The atria act as reservoirs, by which blood returning to the heart is collected via veins and passed on to the ventricles. \\n###\\nQ: Why does the heart have two sets of atria and ventricles?\\nA: The heart has two sets of atria and ventricles because there are two distinct locations for blood transport. The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) and the right side pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation).\\n###\\nQ: What is the difference between the left and right side of the heart in terms of circulation?\\nA: The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body (systemic circulation) and the right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation). There is therefore a separate circulation for the lungs (right side of heart) and for the rest of the body (left side of heart).\\n###\\nQ: Why does the left side of the heart have a much thicker muscular wall?\\nA: The left side of the heart has a much thicker muscular wall (myocardium) because it must pump blood much further than the right side.\",\n          \"Q: What are the two types of animals based on how they manage their internal osmotic conditions?\\nA: The two types of animals based on how they manage their internal osmotic conditions are osmoconformers and osmoregulators.\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ: How do osmoconformers manage their internal osmotic conditions?\\nA: Osmoconformers manage their internal osmotic conditions by maintaining them equal to the osmolarity of their environment. This minimizes water movement in and out of cells, using less energy to maintain internal osmotic conditions.\\n\\n###\\n\\nQ: How do osmoregulators manage their internal osmotic conditions and what is the implication of this process?\\nA: Osmoregulators manage their internal osmotic conditions by keeping their body's osmolarity constant, regardless of environmental conditions. This is a more energy-intensive process, but it ensures that internal osmotic conditions are always tightly controlled.\\n\\n###\\n\\nQ: What is the difference between osmoconformers and osmoregulators in terms of their response to environmental conditions?\\nA: The difference between osmoconformers and osmoregulators in terms of their response to environmental conditions is that osmoregulators can maintain optimal internal conditions irrespective of the environment, while osmoconformers are affected by environmental conditions.\",\n          \"Q: What is a vector in the context of molecular biology?\\nA: A vector is a vehicle that is used to deliver genetic material to a target cell via horizontal gene transfer.\\n\\n###\\nQ: What are the two main classes of vector delivery mechanisms in genetic modification?\\nA: The two main classes of vector delivery mechanisms are viral and non-viral.\\n\\n###\\nQ: What are some examples of non-viral delivery methods for genetic material?\\nA: Examples of non-viral delivery methods include the use of a plasmid, electroporation, heat shocking, particle bombardment, microinjection, and lipofection.\\n\\n###\\nQ: How does viral delivery work and what are some of its advantages and disadvantages?\\nA: Viral delivery works by inserting a viral vector into a cell, a process called transduction, and utilises the ability of a virus to inject its DNA into a host cell. The advantages include the fact that protein synthesis will be driven by endogenous expression patterns. However, a disadvantage is that there is a risk the random insertion into the genome will abrogate key host genes.\\n\\n###\\nQ: What are the differences between DNA genome viruses and RNA genome viruses?\\nA: DNA genome viruses, such as an adenovirus, directly integrate their DNA into the host genome. RNA genome viruses, such as retroviruses, use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert the RNA sequence into a DNA copy prior to integration.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def clean_split(string):\n","    # Split the string by '###'\n","    split_list = string.split('###')\n","    # Filter out any empty or whitespace-only elements\n","    return [item for item in split_list if item.strip()]\n"],"metadata":{"id":"09YeFMo8ZMkA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["clean_split(df_bioninja['Q&A Pairs'][0])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"eNVTH4IdYULs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713265440401,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Alexander Stern","userId":"00538493364231383129"}},"outputId":"d625678e-7b71-4f57-b11b-9d417395e84c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Q: What does the cell theory state about living organisms?\\nA: The cell theory states that all living organisms are composed of cells or cell products. \\n\\n',\n"," '\\nQ: What are the three principles of the cell theory?\\nA: The three principles of the cell theory are: 1.
